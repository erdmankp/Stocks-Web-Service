1. I was able to reach their endpoints, I can successfully make requests and 
Receive responses from the endpoints.

2. This service is unique

3. I think the paths were a bit confusing, for example I don't know what ticker is. Other than that the paths are consistent.

4. The structure of the response is very straightforward and easy to understand

5. I think my service might be easier to make a front end for since stocks have a lot of computation. A significant difference was that you had more endpoints than I did in my project, so I think it makes it easier to maintain in the long run. 

6. The code is well structured and easy to understand

7. I did not find any other issues with your service

8. I do not have any other criticism for this service. I think you provide a lot of endpoints.
