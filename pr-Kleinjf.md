    Were you able to reach their endpoint on the web?
        - I was unable to figure out what their URL is so I couldn't test this online.
        can you successfully make requests and receive responses from all of their endpoints?
            -I was unable to run it locally as we weren't given a credentials.json, but otherwise
            author included everything I would need including the curl commands to run.
    What did you like about this service?
        - It has the potential to show a lot of cool information about stocks. Even
        though I don't play the stocks myself, its quite interesting to observe
        them.
    What do you think about the paths that have been chosen?
        are they consistent? is there any possible point of confusion?
            - They seem good, nothing confusing found.
    What do you like about the structure of the responses from the different endpoints?
        - I was unable to test them, but looking at the code it all looks very well
        done. Very polished, nice job.
    Describe one significant difference between your own P2 seervice and this person's. E.g.
        Which might be easier to build a front end for (and why)?
            - Its close in my mind. It depends what kind of front end you want for the
            stocks. You don't necessarily need a GUI but I think you would want one.
            If you used a GUI it would be on par with my own, though if you didn't
            yours would probably be easier.
        Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    Is the code well-structured?
        The code is well structured from what I can tell, but there isn't a single
        comment in the entire thing. This made reading through it quite difficult.
        if not, suggest some specific improvements
            - I would put some comments in explaining several things. A). what each code block does B). how to edit each code block, and C). how to use each code block endpoint.
    Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
        - No other issues. All the required files were present and the report was
        thourough.
    Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
        might they want to consider adding any endpoint(s) to better facilitate a particular front end feature you're imagining?
        might they be able to include more or less of the data in the response to an endpoint and better support the front end?
        - None, good job!
