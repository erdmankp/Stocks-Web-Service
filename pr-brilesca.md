1: I was able to read thier end points as well as update them, all requests worked and all responses were sent fine.

2:I liked that it was about stocks, although im not super familiar with them but, unique idea that would definelty have real world use.

3:All the endpoints were uniform, although I am not sure if it is supposed to be test or ticker for the end point. 
  Test was the one that worked for me but, I feel like it would make sense if it was ticker/1 or something like that: might just be user error

4:All the end point respose structure was very clear and easy to read.

5:The biggest differnce is my P2 had more end points to it for more specific parts of the data. Korys would be an easier front end to build
since there wouldn't be as many endpoints to maintain and develop for. Korys again would be easier to maintain since there is in general less code and less possible over
lap within the end points.

6:Code is really well structured and easy to read.

7: I was only able to get id:3 in the data base to display but, this might just be user error.

8:no other comments, I think adding more end points would make this convuluded since people will only really want to search for the ticker name so, overall really well done.
